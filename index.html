                    Macabresoft is Brett Story. I make software under this label of sorts.                
                    Pretty much everything I develop is open-source, so check out the <a href="https://github.com/Macabresoft">Macabresoft GitHub page</a> to get into specifics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general, the main focus of Macabresoft is on games with the Macabre2D engine, but I also delve into audio programming and productivity tools.
                    Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/macabresoft">@macabresoft</a> for updates.

                <h1><a href="https://github.com/Macabresoft/Macabre2D">Macabre2D</a></h1>
                <p>
                    A 2D game engine built on top of <a href="https://www.monogame.net/">MonoGame</a>. 
                    Custom features include physics, tile maps, sprite animations, audio playback with looping, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Previously included a Windows only editor, but the entire engine is currently being reworked from the ground up 
                    to support a multi-platform editor using <a href="http://avaloniaui.net/">AvaloniaUI</a>.

                <h1><a href="https://macabresoft.com/piano-chord-catalog/">Piano Chord Catalog</a></h1>
                <p>
                    A piano chord catalog that uses integer notation and math to display finger positions for various chords. The initial focus was common triad chords, but more may come.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was a project to learn a little bit of angular. Sure, you could do something lame like read a book or go to some other website, or you could come look at piano chords on this beautiful web app.
